# Mastering the Data Symphony
In the ever-evolving world of data science and machine learning, there's a profound need to harmonize the diverse tools and projects that are available. The potential for innovation is limitless, but it is essential that efforts are synchronized with the business needs. As my data team grows, I am on a quest for a new understanding of the tools available to help unite our individual talents into a coherent, transformative "symphony" of impactful insights. 

I spent most of 2023 in operational management and thus spent very little time in front of my terminal. This created a wonderful understanding of the business and business needs while simultaneously creating a woeful degradation of my technical skills. Itâ€™s time to jump back in with both feet and knock off the rust related to Automation, Analytics, Python and applied ML in general. As I do so, I am also going to use new tools (or old tools that now integrate in ways that make them new) and document my journey. 

### Day Zero - Configuring Visual Studio Code to Link with GitHub
Visual Studio Code seems to get more powerful each year. It is time to double down and make this my main tool. Not only does it integrate with GitHub, but it should allow me to move quickly between SQL and Anaconda...once I get it all set up correctly. I started by getting my Github synched with VSC. 

**Tools Required**
- Git https://git-scm.com/download/
- GitHub for Desktop https://desktop.github.com/
- Visual Studio Code https://code.visualstudio.com/

**Code Required**
- git add . (this places the files you want saved into the staging area) 
- git commit -m "filename" (this is what saves the changes and cannot occur without git add being done first) 
- git push (pushes from the local branch into the cloud/remote branch

**My Notes about the project**
- Cloning a repo is really only done once in the beginning. It creates an exact copy of all of the files, branches and commits on my local machine, allowing me to make edits locally. 
- I had to install the "Live Server" package in order to see my HTML code online (right click, open in Live Server)
- You can save your work (commit) in both VSC and Github Desktop
- I used the BASH terminal for the code

**How these tools work together**
- My Github profile is the online host
- Visual Studio Code is the local host (Desktop)
- Github Desktop is the middle buffer that connect the local host to the online host

NEXT STEPS
- Add in the steps I used to complete the project to include get pull
- research/learn how to update VSC/GHD to reflect the changed repo name
- create a file for learning resources and add in this https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/
- Grab screen shots from the project
- Update the folder location on  my local machine to NOT be in onedrive
- Determine why the local update of the readme file did not work (I suspect I did not save it first in VSC)
