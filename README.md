# Mastering the Data Symphony
In the ever-evolving world of data science and machine learning, there's a profound need to harmonize the diverse tools and projects that are available. The potential for innovation is limitless, but it is essential that efforts are synchronized with the business needs. As my data team grows, I am on a quest for a new understanding of the tools available to help unite our individual talents into a coherent, transformative "symphony" of impactful insights. 

I spent most of 2023 in operational management and thus spent very little time in front of my terminal. This created a wonderful understanding of the business and business needs while simultaneously creating a woeful degradation of my technical skills. Itâ€™s time to jump back in with both feet and knock off the rust related to Automation, Analytics, Python and applied ML in general. As I do so, I am also going to use new tools (or old tools that now integrate in ways that make them new) and document my journey. 

### Day Zero - Configuring Visual Studio Code to Link with GitHub
Visual Studio Code seems to get more powerful each year. It is time to double down and make this my main tool. Not only does it integrate with GitHub, but it should allow me to move quickly between SQL and Anaconda...once I get it all set up correctly. I started by getting my Github synched with VSC. 

**Tools Required**
- Git https://git-scm.com/download/
- GitHub for Desktop https://desktop.github.com/
- Visual Studio Code https://code.visualstudio.com/
